# Bipolar-Disorder-Diagnosis

 This study aims to explore the predictive capabilities of various machine learning
 models for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder using a structured dataset containing
 mental health variables. Regression and multiple classification techniques were em
ployed, including logistic regression, classification trees, random forests, XGBoost,
 and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). Advanced techniques such as PCA and t-SNE were
 used for dimensionality reduction, followed by agglomerative and K-Means cluster
ing to investigate potential intrinsic groupings within the data.
